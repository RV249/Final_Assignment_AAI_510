# Project Description

In our project we are a consulting group that will build and evaluate a machine learning model to determine whether an individual is a 'bad' or 'good' credit risk. A ‘good’ credit risk indicates the probability that the consumer will be financially beneficial for the credit card company. This entails evaluating if the consumer will use the card regularly, maintain a balance to incur interest charges, and will make regular and timely payments. A 'bad' credit risk indicates an inability to make regular and timely payments.  

We will be using decision tree and random forest for the prediction but before that will be putting extra effort to identify the right features and clean the data to ensure that the results come back without noise.
